# Ai Vis

We should implment stubs for the abstract classes as needed.
We can start with a simple implementation and update it along with the tests as
we flesh out a real implementation. 

We might not have a factory so much as a main class holding refs. The transformer could be this class and would be "initialized" by the loader

Later improvements
- transformer wrapper that is qobject and can be moved to a new thread
